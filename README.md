# REST client
An application that issues HTTP Requests to a REST service on GitHub. You'll read information in JSON format, and convert that JSON packet into C# objects. 

## How to use it:
Simple [install Dotnet Core V2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linux/rhel) and run the command:

```
dotnet run
```

Inside the project folder.
If some dependecy is missing, you must run:
```
 dotnet restore
```
And **NuGet** will install it for you.
